In this booklet, our focus is to take you through a journey in time, traversing the life cycle of stars, from its lustrous beginning to its lightless end. There lies a strong reason behind the name we chose for this report, it starts with stellar evolution, since stars evolve to many different objects during their lifecycle; they start out as clouds of hydrogen floating through interstellar space and then become stars that then evolve to red giants that might again form clouds that would lead to the birth of other stars that can die with supernova explosions and then either become neutron stars or even better, black holes.
This very end of their life, which comprises in becoming a black hole, is the reason why the name ends with “lightless fates”, hence black holes are completely lightless, due to them not allowing any light to escape from their event horizons, they are perfect black bodies.</p>
